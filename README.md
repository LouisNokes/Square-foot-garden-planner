# React Native Square foot garden planning tool with firebase

## Getting Started (with Expo)

If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

```
cd react-native-firebase
npm install
expo start
react-native run-android (Emulate android device using android studio)
```

Some libraries may need to be downloaded separately using NPM as I was not able to upload the full file due to size limits.

This React Native Square foot garden tool is built with Firebase Web SDK, which makes it compatible with both Expo CLI and React Native CLI.

All images used in this project are taken from Flaticon a database of free vector icons
